	- [x] accessing
	- [x] iterating an array
	- [x] My own tools

_Need to know the basics about Arrays they are a bit primitive to work with. It's great to understand and know how to work with it.
Later on might not use it that much._

## What
A way of Storing multiple values under one variable name.

Index based. (Starts at 0)
Easily searchable.

## Why
Way of storing multiple values.
Brings fundamentals understanding how code works.

## How

Using Syntax: []

ex:
```java
int[] numbers = {0,2,5,125,34,643}

numbers[0] // 0 - first Element
numbers[3] // 125 - third Element
numbers[numbers.length -1] // 643 - last Element

```

# java.util.Arrays

[Arrays (Java Platform SE 7 ) (oracle.com)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html)

- [x] toString
- [x] Sort
- [x] BinarySearch
- [x] CopyOf
- [X] CopyOfRange
- [] fill


## WHAT?
util = "toolbox"

- Part of the Java Collection Framework.
java.lang.Object
â†³ java.util.Arrays

 - static methods, Sort, search, fill, copy and many more..
 - If the array is null the util.arrays will give us a -NullPointerException

## WHY?
 - Effective tools to learn when working with arrays.
 - Eliminate many loops. Code more clean and focused code.
 -

## HOW?
 1. Import Arrays.class from java.util.* package.
 2. Arrays.<methods name>;
